Stereotypes/Struggles:  

While some people believe that all bisexual people are attracted to every gender equally, and while that is true for some people, some bisexual people prefer a certain gender 

People believe that bisexuality is simply being confused or is just a phase and will eventually lead to being gay or straight. However, bisexuality is valid and for most people it is not just a transitional period to discover that they’re gay 

Even if bisexual people are in a relationship with the opposite or same gender, they are still bisexual. For instance, if a bisexual woman is in a relationship with a boy, she is still bisexual 

A common myth with bisexuality is that bisexual people are more likely to cheat. This is absolutely not true, and someone’s sexuality does not dictate how good or bad of a person they are.
