<p style="font-family:Courier; font-size: 14px;"> Name: Bisexuality Definition: Being attracted to 2 or more genders.</p>
    
    
<p style="font-family:Courier; font-size: 14px;"> 
    
Incorrect stereotypes: <ul>
    
    <li>Bi men are just gay with internalized homophobia- 1.8% of adults identify as bi, so don’t ever talk to me or my 13,500,000 friends again </li>
<li>Bi girls are just straight and lying- kinda odd that both of these stereotypes are centered around everyone being attracted to men, huh?</li>
<li>Bi people are cheaters- your sexuality doesn’t define if you’re a bad person or not</li>
<li>Bi people don’t belong in the lgbtq+ community because they’re half straight- you still like boys and girls, and the lgbtq+ community is for people who don’t fit into the “normal” idea of sexuality</li>
<li>Bi people like every gender equally- nope, sexuality is a spectrum and preferences vary on the person</li>
<li>Bi people only like cis people- example: trans men are men, and bi people like men, so no???</li>
<li>Just indecisive- no, people who like multiple genders at the same time exist</li>
</ul>
