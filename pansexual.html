PANSEXUAL PALS


Pan- attracted to all genders without noticing gender

Incorrect stereotypes-

  <ul>
  
<li> Pan people are just bi- no, don’t invalidate pan people, and bi people might not like all genders </li>

<li> ”Man, you’re so desperate you’ll date anyone, huh?”- can we not invalidate pan people k thx </li>

<li> Pan people are biphobic- no, as a bi person, I can confirm that pan people are pretty chill  </li>

     </ul>
